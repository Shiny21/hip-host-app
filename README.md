This project demonstrates a **pluggable micro-frontend architecture** with dynamic runtime loading of multiple micro-frontends (Auth, Booking, Reporting). The host app orchestrates the communication between micro-frontends via a **central event bus**, mimicking a real-world ticket booking system.

## Features

- Dynamically loads micro-frontends via environment variables or remote configuration.
- Real-time event-driven communication between micro-frontends.
- Centralized error handling using `ErrorBoundary`.
- Role-based access control and live analytics dashboards.
- Temporary seat lock to prevent concurrency conflicts in booking.

## Step-by-Step Documented Flow

### 1. User Authentication and Session Management
- **Action:** User logs in via Auth-App.
- **Event Published:** `userLoggedIn` with `userId` and `role`.
- **Reaction:**  
  - Booking-App activates seat selection and booking forms.  
  - Reporting-App checks user role; admin users see advanced dashboards.

### 2. Real-Time Seat Selection & Concurrency
- **Action:** User selects a seat in Booking-App.
- **Event Published:** `seatSelected` with `matchId` and `seatId`.
- **Reaction:**  
  - Reporting-App updates live seat map.  
  - Seat is temporarily reserved to prevent concurrent selection by others.

### 3. Booking Confirmation & Real-Time Analytics
- **Action:** User confirms booking.
- **Event Published:** `ticketBooked` and `analyticsEvent` with `BOOKING_CONFIRMED`.
- **Reaction:**  
  - Reporting-App updates dashboards and revenue charts in real-time.  
  - Provides live analytics on ticket sales and revenue.

### 4. Error & Failure Handling
- **Action:** Booking fails (payment error, seat conflict, etc.).
- **Event Published:** `bookingFailed` with `errorMessage`.
- **Reaction:**  
  - Booking-App displays user-friendly notification.  
  - Reporting-App logs failures for analysis.
